# ue14500_code
Code emulation for the Usagi Electric 'UE14500' one-bit cpu

Specifically built to investigate the problem of decoding a 4-bit number to drive a 7-segment display.  
A whole lot of logic gates would be required for this, so it seems like a very appropriate problem for an MC14500 coding project.

In response to the "Vacuum Tube Computer" YouTube videos by Usagi Electric.
