# ue14500_code
Code simulator for the Usagi Electric 'UE14500' one-bit cpu

Specifically built to investigate the problem of decoding a 4-bit number to drive a 7-segment display.  
A whole lot of logic gates would be required for this, so it seems like a very appropriate problem for an MC14500 coding project.  
( Note : the novel arithmetic instructions (add/sub) are not used at present.  It's not clear whether they might have a role here.
In any case, I'm not completely certain of their implementation. )

In response to the "Vacuum Tube Computer" YouTube videos by Usagi Electric.
